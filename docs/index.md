# Use your communications archive

msgvault keeps email, chat, meetings, calendars, and contacts on your own
hardware. These guides help you bring data in, find what matters, and maintain
the archive through the browser, terminal, CLI, or an agent.

  <a class="md-button" href="/docs/changelog/#0200">Changelog</a>
</p>

!!! note "Returning after 0.19?"
    The [0.20.0 changelog](changelog.md#0200) lists the new capabilities.
    Read the [upgrade notes](changelog.md#upgrade-and-compatibility) before
    opening an existing archive with the new version.

## Start an archive

1. [Install msgvault](setup.md).
2. [Choose a source](guides/sources.md) and follow its sync or import guide.
3. Open the [Web UI](web-ui.md) or [TUI](usage/tui.md) to browse your messages.
4. [Create a backup](usage/backup.md) before making substantial changes.

Google OAuth setup is needed for Google-backed sources. Local imports and other
providers have their own requirements. To understand the product first, read
the [archive lifecycle](/guide/) or the [project's origin](introduction.md).

## Find messages and files

| Your question | Guide |
|---|---|
| Who sent this, and when? | [Keyword search and filters](usage/searching.md) |
| How do I search by meaning? | [Semantic and hybrid search](usage/vector-search.md) |

| How can an AI assistant use it? | [MCP](usage/chat.md) and [agent skills](guides/agent-skills.md) |

## Keep track of people

[People and profiles](usage/people.md) explains observed identities, durable
profiles, contact activity, and relationship curation. Start there to connect
addresses and handles, maintain contacts, or set up optional profile automation.
Use [accounts and collections](usage/multi-account.md) to organize sources and
limit an archive view.
