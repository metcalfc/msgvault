## OAuth Errors

### "Error 403: access_denied"

Your email isn't added as a test user. Go to **OAuth consent screen > Test users** and add your Gmail address. For Workspace accounts using a named OAuth app, add the test user in that org's Google Cloud project.

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

The Gmail scope isn't configured. Verify you added `gmail.modify` on the **Data Access** page and that Gmail API is enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### "Access blocked" or "app not approved" for Workspace accounts

The Workspace organization restricts OAuth to apps created within their org. Create a separate Google Cloud project inside the org and configure it as a named OAuth app. See [OAuth Setup: Google Workspace Accounts](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#google-workspace-accounts).

### "redirect_uri_mismatch"

Wrong application type. Ensure you selected **Desktop app** when creating OAuth credentials.

### "OAuth client is missing redirect_uris"

You created a "TVs and Limited Input devices" OAuth client, which doesn't work with Gmail. Google's device code flow does not support Gmail scopes. Create a new OAuth client with **Desktop app** type instead.

### Read-only Gmail access

By default `add-account` requests `gmail.readonly` and `gmail.modify`. Pass `--readonly` to request read access only:

```bash
msgvault add-account you@gmail.com --readonly
```

Sync, search, and the TUI all work on a read-only grant. Deletion does not — see below.

Restricting scopes on the **Data Access** page in the Google Cloud Console will not do this for you. That page declares which scopes your app may ask for during verification review; it does not limit what the authorization server grants at request time. Nor can you decline a scope on the consent screen: msgvault rejects a token that comes back with fewer scopes than it asked for. Changing what the client requests is the only thing that works, which is what `--readonly` does.

#### "already has Gmail write access"

```
you@gmail.com already has Gmail write access (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify)
```

`--readonly` cannot take away access an account already has. Re-authorizing does not revoke the previous grant — a refresh token issued beforehand keeps working with its original write scopes — and revoking applies to the whole grant, so revoking the old credential would invalidate the replacement too. There is no way to narrow in place, and `--force` is refused for the same reason.

To make the account read-only, remove its access and grant it again:

1. Revoke msgvault at [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. `rm ~/.msgvault/tokens/you@gmail.com.json`
3. `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com --readonly`

Revoking clears every other Google scope for the account, so re-run whichever commands granted them — `add-calendar` for Calendar, `add-synctech-sms-drive` for Drive. Archived mail is unaffected. Confirm the result by reading the token's `scopes` array rather than the permissions page, which reports what msgvault is authorized to request.

The same refusal applies to an account holding the broad `https://mail.google.com/` scope, which msgvault grants when you escalate for permanent deletion.

The refusal also fires when the token is stored under a Gmail alias spelling of the address you typed (dots, `+suffix`, `googlemail.com`) — Google treats those as the same account, so setting up a second spelling read-only would leave the stored spelling's access in place. The message names the stored spelling to use, or the full revoke-and-re-add procedure when both spellings hold tokens.

`msgvault remove-account` revokes the account's Google grant (best-effort) before deleting its token file, so removing an account and re-adding it with `--readonly` yields a genuinely fresh, read-only grant.

#### "currently has read-only Gmail access"

A plain `add-account` run against a read-only account warns before requesting write access again. Re-run with `--readonly` to keep the narrower grant. Running `add-account --readonly` against an account that is already read-only does nothing and reuses the existing token.

#### Narrowing on a headless server

The revoke-and-re-add procedure above works unchanged. Step 3 prints an authorization URL you open from any browser, then waits for the callback on `localhost:8089` — reach it with `curl` on the host, or forward the port with `ssh -L 8089:localhost:8089 user@server`. See [Headless Server Issues](#headless-server-issues).

#### Deletion on a read-only account

Staged deletions need write access that a read-only account does not have, so `delete-staged` offers to re-authorize:

- **Trash** (the default) needs `gmail.modify`, or the broader `https://mail.google.com/` if the account already holds it.
- **Permanent** (`--permanent`) needs `https://mail.google.com/`; `gmail.modify` does not cover batch deletion.

Declining the prompt leaves both the token and the staged batch untouched. Accepting it widens the grant, so an account you want to keep read-only should decline.

### General OAuth Issues

1. Remove old tokens: `rm ~/.msgvault/tokens/you@gmail.com.json`
2. Re-add account: `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com`
3. Revoke and retry: [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

## Headless Server Issues

### "No browser available"

The standard OAuth flow requires a browser. For headless servers, use the copy-token workflow:

1. Authorize on a machine with a browser: `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com`
2. Copy the token file to your server: `scp ~/.msgvault/tokens/you@gmail.com.json user@server:~/.msgvault/tokens/`
3. Register on the server: `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com`

Run `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com --headless` to see detailed instructions with the exact paths for your configuration.

### Token copied but "account not found"

After copying the token, you must run `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com` on the headless server to register the account in the database. This command detects the existing token and registers the account without opening a browser.

## Remote Deployment Issues

### `export-token` says HTTPS is required

`msgvault export-token` enforces HTTPS by default. Most deployments use Tailscale or a home LAN where HTTP is fine — add `--allow-insecure`:

```bash
msgvault export-token you@gmail.com --to http://nas-ip:8080 --api-key KEY --allow-insecure
```

To avoid passing the flag every time, run `msgvault setup` with a remote server configured (it sets `allow_insecure = true` in your local config automatically), or add it manually:

```toml
[remote]
allow_insecure = true
```

### `export-token` returns 401/Forbidden

1. Verify your remote server has an `api_key` in `[server]`.
2. Confirm `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_API_KEY` / `--api-key` matches that value.
3. Ensure the remote endpoint is reachable from the local machine.

### Remote command behaves unexpectedly

Remote-aware CLI commands use `[remote].url` automatically when it is set. This includes `sync`, `sync-full`, `verify`, `search`, `query`, `show-message`, `stats`, aggregate list commands, identity commands, collection commands, attachment exports, `update-account`, `repair-encoding`, `rebuild-fts`, `build-cache`, `cache-stats`, and `tui`.

For archive-access commands, use `--local` when you want the same CLI command to talk to the local background daemon instead of the configured remote:

```bash
msgvault list-accounts --local
msgvault rebuild-fts --local
```

## Docker Container Issues

### Container won't start

Check logs first:

```bash
docker logs msgvault
```

Common causes:
- Missing `config.toml` with `[oauth] client_secrets` and `[server] bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"` + `api_key`
- Port 8080 already in use — change `api_port` in config or the port mapping in docker-compose.yml
- Volume mount permissions — on Synology, add `user: root` to docker-compose.yml (see [Platform Notes](/docs/guides/remote-deployment/#platform-notes))

### `permission denied` on Synology

Synology ACLs override standard Unix permissions. Add `user: root` to your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  msgvault:
    image: ghcr.io/kenn-io/msgvault:latest
    user: root
    # ... rest of config
```

### Scheduled sync not running

1. Verify accounts are configured in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [[accounts]]
   email = "you@gmail.com"
   schedule = "0 2 * * *"
   enabled = true
   ```

2. Verify the token exists:
   ```bash
   docker exec msgvault ls -la /data/tokens/
   ```

3. Check scheduler status:
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-API-Key: KEY" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/scheduler/status
   ```

4. For Gmail, make sure you've run the initial full sync before relying on its
   incremental schedule. Run `sync-full` through the container's CLI; it will
   connect to the running daemon over HTTP and stream progress back to your
   terminal:
   ```bash
   docker exec msgvault msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com
   ```

   Discord does not require a separate initial manual sync: its first
   scheduled run backfills history and checkpoints progress. Register the
   guild with `add-discord` first, and use its exact guild ID (not its display
   name) as the `[[accounts]].email` value.

### "No source found for email"

The account isn't registered in the database. Re-export the token from your local machine:

```bash
msgvault export-token you@gmail.com --to http://nas-ip:8080 --api-key KEY --allow-insecure
```

This uploads the token and registers the account. If the token file already exists on the server, register it directly:

```bash
docker exec msgvault msgvault add-account you@gmail.com
```

## Rate Limiting

If you hit Gmail API rate limits during large syncs, the sync error names
the refusal, for example `quota exceeded (403): rateLimitExceeded; Quota
exceeded for quota metric 'Total Query Cost' and limit 'Units per minute per
user'`. The Gmail client waits out each quota pause and retries up to five
times. This applies to profile, labels, history, message listings, and raw
downloads; draft writes are not replayed. Caller cancellation or an earlier
deadline stops the wait. A failed full sync resumes from its checkpoint.

1. Reduce [`rate_limit_qps`](configuration.md#sync) in config (default: `5`).
   The local budget can exceed your project's Gmail quota. Lowering this
   setting also slows Teams imports.
2. Use `--limit` during initial testing
3. Wait and retry. Rate limits reset over time

## Database Corruption

Do not delete a corrupt database. An archive can contain local imports and
provider-deleted messages that a new sync cannot recover.

1. Stop the daemon with `msgvault daemon stop` or stop its Docker/systemd
   service.
2. Preserve the complete data directory, including the database, WAL and SHM
   files, attachments, configuration, and tokens.
3. Restore a verified snapshot into an empty directory. Follow
   [Restoring to a New Machine](/docs/usage/backup/#restoring-to-a-new-machine);
   the same empty-target rule applies on the original machine.

If no verified backup exists, keep the damaged directory unchanged and ask for
recovery help before initializing another archive. Re-syncing is only a
reconstruction option when every source record is still available upstream.

## Interrupted Syncs

Run the same sync command again. It resumes from the last checkpoint:

```bash
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --after 2024-01-01 --before 2024-02-01
```

To force a fresh start:

```bash
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --noresume
```

## CGO / Build Errors

If you get errors about missing C compiler:

- **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- **Linux**: Install GCC: `apt install gcc` or `dnf install gcc`

CGO is required for `mattn/go-sqlite3` (FTS5 support).

If the build reaches the cgo step and fails with `fatal error: sqlite3.h: No
such file or directory` (from `asg017/sqlite-vec-go-bindings`), you are missing
the SQLite development headers that the default `sqlite_vec` build needs:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install -y libsqlite3-dev`
- **Fedora/RHEL**: `sudo dnf install -y sqlite-devel`

## TUI Not Showing Data

If the TUI launches but shows no data:

1. Verify sync completed: `msgvault stats`
2. Rebuild the Parquet cache: `msgvault build-cache --full-rebuild`
3. Check the in-TUI account filter (shown in the title bar): press `A` to open the account selector and switch to "All Accounts"

## Web UI and API Server Issues

### "api_key is required for non-loopback bind address"

You set `bind_addr` to a non-loopback address (e.g., `0.0.0.0`) without configuring an API key. Either add an `api_key` to your `[server]` config, or set `allow_insecure = true` if you understand the security implications. See [Web UI & API Server: Security Model](/docs/api-server/#security-model).

### The UI reports a missing, stale, or unavailable analytical cache

Run `msgvault build-cache`, then restart a daemon that was already running. The
Web UI preserves the reported cache state instead of silently switching some
modalities to a different query engine. See [Web UI: Cache states](/docs/web-ui/#cache-states)
and [Configuration: analytics](/docs/configuration/#analytics).

### The UI warns that the session cookie is not secure

The browser reached a remote daemon over plain HTTP. Prefer HTTPS at a reverse
proxy and configure that proxy in `server.trusted_proxies`. Do not trust a whole
client network merely to suppress the warning. See [Web UI: Remote access and
HTTPS](/docs/web-ui/#remote-access-and-https).

### Port already in use

Another process is using the configured port. Either stop the other process, or change `api_port` in your `[server]` config:

```toml
[server]
api_port = 9090
```

### HTTP 429 Too Many Requests

The general API limit allows 10 requests per second per client IP with a burst
of 20. Trusted, authenticated loopback requests are exempt, except session
login. Some expensive endpoints have tighter limits. If you receive 429, space
out requests and follow the `Retry-After` header.

## Using Logs for Troubleshooting

Enable file logging to capture detailed diagnostics. Add this to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[log]
enabled = true
```

Then reproduce the issue. Each run gets a unique correlation ID (`run_id`) so you can isolate its log lines:

```bash
# View today's log
msgvault logs

# Follow live while reproducing an issue
msgvault logs -f

# Filter to a specific run
msgvault logs --run-id <id>

# Show only errors
msgvault logs --level error
```

`msgvault logs` reads from the selected daemon. If `[remote].url` is configured, it shows the remote daemon's logs; otherwise it starts or contacts the local daemon.

For one-off debugging without changing config, use the `--log-file` flag:

```bash
msgvault sync --log-file /tmp/debug.log --log-level debug
```

To trace slow SQL queries, lower the threshold or enable full SQL tracing:

```bash
# Log queries slower than 50ms
msgvault tui --log-sql-slow-ms 50

# Log every SQL query (verbose)
msgvault tui --log-sql
```

Log files are stored in `<data_dir>/logs/` by default. Run `msgvault logs --path` to print the selected daemon's directory. See [Configuration: Log](/docs/configuration/#log) for all options.

## Still Stuck?
