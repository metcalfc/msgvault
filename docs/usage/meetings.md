title: Meeting Transcripts
description: Archive AI meeting notes and transcripts from Granola, Circleback, and Notion into your searchable local archive.
---

Find meeting decisions and transcripts in the same archive as your email and
chats. Each meeting becomes one searchable message with a title, notes or
summary, and a transcript when the source provides one. Verified participant
emails connect meetings to the people you already know in msgvault.

## Choose a meeting source

| Source | Connection | Main coverage limit |
|---|---|---|
| [Granola](#granola) | API key | Requires access to Granola's public API |
| [Notion AI Meeting Notes](#notion-ai-meeting-notes) | Notion integration token | At most 50 attendee-visible meetings per discovery query |
| [Circleback](#circleback) | Browser authorization to its MCP server | Older note edits require a full refresh |
| [Another meeting source](#import-from-any-meeting-source) | Authenticated JSON import | Your integration supplies each meeting and its updates |

Provider sync reads meeting data without changing the source service. Recording
media is not downloaded by the Notion or Circleback integrations.

## Browse and search

Start `msgvault serve` and open the [Web UI](/docs/web-ui/). Its
[Meetings](/docs/web-ui/#meetings) page lists meetings that already happened.
In the [Inbox](/docs/web-ui/#inbox-and-search), filter to meeting notes or
search across notes, email, and chats.
To search only meetings from the CLI:

```bash
msgvault search "quarterly budget" --message-type meeting_transcript
```

In the [TUI](/docs/usage/tui/), press `m` until the title shows **Meetings**.
Use `A` to select a source, `/` to search, and `Enter` to open the note and
transcript. In the detail view, `/` finds text and `n`/`N` moves between
matches. Meetings mode does not offer selection or deletion.

Unscoped search includes meetings and chats. Email-specific CLI and TUI
aggregates remain email-only unless you choose another message type.

## Export context and read follow-ups

In the Inbox or Search, select meeting rows and choose **Export meeting context**. You
can select explicit rows or **Select all matching items** for the current
search and filters. The export includes exactly that selection. Mixed selections
fail with **Select meetings only**; narrow selections larger than 100 meetings.
Choose JSON or Markdown. **Include transcript** is off by default.

The downloaded file contains the server's context packet, including meeting
references, participants, summary, notes, recorded actions, and coverage states.
The default content budget is 131072 UTF-8 bytes. CLI and API clients can set
4096 through 1048576 bytes. Packets report truncation and omitted meeting IDs;
check those fields before treating an export as complete. A missing summary
stays missing. msgvault does not generate a replacement from the transcript.

**Meeting activity and follow-ups** appears in a meeting-filtered Inbox view,
participant and domain reading panes, and a person's **Meetings** tab in
[People](/docs/web-ui/#people). It follows the current scope. Filter action items by source
status or exact assignee email, then use **Open archived meeting** to read the
source evidence. Back returns to the same view and scope.

Action status is the last archived source status, not a local task list.
msgvault does not create follow-ups or mark source tasks done. It shows the
meeting tool's assignee when there is one and never replaces it. For an item
the tool left unassigned, the optional
[meeting action assignee](jev-judgments.md#feature-meeting-action-assignee)
judgment can infer an attendee or you as its owner; the row then carries an
`inferred_assignee` with provenance `inferred` and its confidence, and the Web
UI marks it "(inferred, 91%)". Filter by person with `--assignee-person-id`
(CLI) or `assignee_person_id` (HTTP and MCP): it matches items whose source
assignee address is one of the person's and items inferred to one of the
person's participants.
Supported empty action lists, unsupported sources, unavailable evidence, and
partial evidence remain distinct. Granola has no structured action support;
Circleback and generic imports preserve explicit actions; Notion exposes
checkboxes from archived summary and notes blocks. A Notion checkbox does not
supply an assignee merely because a name appears in its text.

Use the daemon-backed CLI for the same evidence:

```bash
msgvault meetings context --id 42 --id 43 --format json --output meeting-context.json
msgvault meetings actions --domain example.com --status pending --assignee alex@example.com
msgvault meetings metrics --person-id 7 --after 2026-01-01 --before 2026-03-01 --json
```

The three MCP read tools are `get_meeting_context`, `list_meeting_action_items`,
and `get_meeting_metrics`. They require no AI provider call or profile-write
permission. CLI dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`; HTTP and MCP scope dates use full
RFC3339 timestamps. See the [CLI flags](../cli-reference.md#meetings),
[HTTP contract](../api-server.md#meeting-intelligence), and
[MCP examples](chat.md#meeting-evidence).

## Understand meeting time and coverage

Meeting metrics show the number of meetings, known and unknown durations,
total known time, average known duration, and monthly activity. Unknown
durations are excluded from averages. When no duration is known, the average
is unavailable (`null` in JSON), not zero.

| Duration basis | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Provider | Explicit provider duration, Notion recording start/end, or generic meeting start/end |
| Scheduled | Calendar start and end |
| Transcript span | Earliest through latest usable transcript timing |
| Unknown duration | No usable duration evidence; no duration basis is assigned |

JSON names these bases `provider`, `scheduled`, and `transcript_span`.
Scheduled time and transcript span are estimates of different things. The
basis breakdown keeps those differences visible. Months without meetings are
omitted; undated meetings appear in a separate count.

Meeting reads include source-deleted records by default while their archive
content remains present. Use `--deletion active` or `--deletion deleted` to
narrow actions and metrics. Locally deleted records are excluded. This does not
change the [garbage collection workflow](../cli-reference.md#gc).

Explore scopes preserve the full search predicate and its cache/search
identity. Their transfer ceiling is 10000 matching message IDs; narrow a scope
that exceeds it. A changed or expired result requires a reload. Errors remain
visible instead of silently dropping filters or sampling visible rows.

Existing archives gain meeting projections from their stored raw evidence on
upgrade, without a provider resync. Evidence absent from an older raw snapshot
still appears as unavailable or partial. Upgrade the daemon as well as clients;
meeting operations need daemon API schema 2.27.0 or newer.

## How calendar events count as meetings

Relationship rankings count shared meetings more than mail. A calendar event
counts as a meeting with its attendees only when it is one, and a crowded
meeting counts for less than a small one:

| Event | Weight |
|---|---|
| Cancelled, declined by you (under any of your addresses), out of office, focus time, working location, or marked free (transparent) | 0: no contact at all, in rankings and in last-contact dates |
| A series Jev judged with probability 0.60 or more | By kind: one-on-one and small working meeting 1, social 0.5 (1 when only you and one other person are invited), large group or all-hands 0.25, outside webinar and personal hold 0 |
| Anything else | 1 up to 10 attendees, then 10 divided by the attendee count |

Rooms and equipment are never attendees. Calendar sync records your RSVP and
the attendee count; events synced before that need a resync to pick up a
decline. The event kind judgment is optional, off by default, and described in
[Jev judgments](jev-judgments.md#feature-meeting-event-kind). A meeting count
(`meeting_count`) counts each event with a weight above 0 once; only the
relationship score uses the weight itself.

## Source labels and account identity

Each meeting source has two distinct values:

- `identifier` is a stable label used in commands, source metadata, schedules,
  and (for Circleback) the token filename. It can be an arbitrary name such as
  `work`.
- `account_email` is the normalized primary email used to determine whether
  the meeting organizer is you (`is_from_me`).

`account_email` is required independently of `identifier`. Config loading
rejects a missing or invalid value with guidance to preserve the source label
and add the account email separately.

`add-granola`, `add-circleback`, and `add-notion-meetings` always confirm the primary email for their
source. Add other confirmed aliases with the identity command:

```bash
msgvault identity add work you+meetings@example.com
```

Adding a new confirmed identity immediately repairs `is_from_me` on matching
messages already stored for that source. No provider resync is required.

## Import from any meeting source

The provider-neutral import API archives one meeting at a time and requires no
`[[granola]]`, `[[circleback]]`, or other provider configuration. Configure an
API key, start `msgvault serve`, then send authenticated JSON to
`POST /api/v1/import/meeting`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/import/meeting \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "source": {
      "identifier": "local-meetings",
      "display_name": "Local Meetings",
      "account_email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "meeting": {
      "external_id": "weekly-planning-42",
      "title": "Weekly planning",
      "started_at": "2026-07-29T09:00:00-04:00",
      "summary_markdown": "## Decisions\n\nShip the new importer.",
      "action_items": [
        {"title": "Send the recap", "assignee_email": "alex@example.com", "status": "pending"}
      ],
      "transcript_segments": [
        {"speaker": "Alex", "text": "Let's ship it.", "offset_seconds": 4}
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Choose a stable `source.identifier` for the upstream dataset and preserve the
upstream meeting ID as `meeting.external_id`. That pair is the idempotency key:
the first import returns `201` with status `created`; unchanged retries and
replacements return `200` with status `updated` without creating duplicates.
`source.account_email` identifies you for sender attribution and becomes a
confirmed identity for the whole source.

Use `"action_items": []` when the source supports actions and recorded none.
Omit `action_items` when it does not provide structured actions. These states
are different: omission is unsupported, while an explicit empty list is
available evidence with zero actions. `null` is invalid. Each action needs a
nonblank `title`; optional fields are `source_id`, `description`,
`assignee_name`, `assignee_email`, `status`, and `due_date`.

Each meeting needs at least one summary, a plain transcript, or segmented
transcript. Plain and segmented transcripts are mutually exclusive. Timestamps
use RFC 3339 with an explicit offset, request bodies are limited to 16 MiB, and
provider-specific fields belong under `meeting.metadata`. These sources are
on-demand: import through the API again to add or update meetings rather than
using **Sync now** or a scheduler.

## Granola

### Prerequisites

- A [Granola](https://granola.ai) account on a **Business** plan — the public
  API is not available on individual plans.
- An API key, created in the Granola desktop app under **Settings**. Keys look
  like `grn_…`.

!!! note "Why not the local cache?"
    Current Granola versions encrypt their on-disk cache, so msgvault reads
    the official API instead of scraping local files.

### Configure and register

Add one `[[granola]]` entry per Granola account to `config.toml`:

```toml
[[granola]]
identifier = "work"              # stable source label
account_email = "you@example.com" # primary identity for organizer matching
api_key = "grn_..."              # from the desktop app's settings
schedule = "0 */6 * * *"         # optional: daemon cron schedule
enabled = true
```

Then validate the key and register the source:

```bash
msgvault add-granola work
```

With a single configured entry the identifier argument may be omitted.

### Sync

```bash
msgvault sync-granola                      # all configured accounts
msgvault sync-granola work                 # one account
msgvault sync-granola --limit 5            # limited production validation
msgvault sync-granola --full               # re-fetch everything, repair in place
msgvault sync-granola --after 2024-01-01   # bound a full sync by creation date
```

Sync is incremental: only notes updated since the last successful run are
fetched (Granola's `updated_after` filter), so edits to notes and late
transcription both flow into the archive. Re-fetched notes are upserted in
place — no duplicates.

To try a newly configured account with a small production sync, start with:

```bash
msgvault sync-granola work --limit 5
msgvault search "meeting topic" --message-type meeting_transcript
```

Inspect a few results for the expected title, summary, speaker-labeled
transcript, organizer, attendees, and `is_from_me` attribution. Running the
same limited sync again updates the existing meeting rows rather than creating
duplicates. Once the results look correct, run `msgvault sync-granola work`
without a limit to continue normal incremental operation.

### Scheduling and partial results

With a `schedule` set, `msgvault serve` runs the sync on that cron cadence,
like `[[gcal]]` calendar sources. Registration is intentionally durable: if
the Granola source is removed from the archive, a configured schedule refuses
to recreate it and tells you to run `msgvault add-granola <identifier>`.

If one note fails after other notes were written, the run is recorded and
reported as failed and the successful cursor does not advance. The CLI or
scheduler refreshes the searchable cache for any successful additions or
updates before returning that partial-sync error, so already-written notes
remain searchable. Fix the reported problem and rerun the same sync.

### What gets stored

| Archive field | Granola source |
|---|---|
| Subject / conversation title | Note title (falling back to the calendar event title) |
| Sent time | Scheduled meeting start, else first transcript timestamp |
| From | Meeting organizer (else the note owner) |
| To | Attendees |
| Body | AI summary (markdown) + `[mm:ss] Speaker: text` transcript |
| Metadata | Duration, web link, calendar event ID, folders, segment count |
| Raw archive | The verbatim API response (`granola_json`) |

## Notion AI Meeting Notes

Notion sync uses the official read-only Meeting Notes and block APIs. It does
not modify pages, upload content, or download recording media. Visibility is
attendee-scoped to the Notion user associated with the integration; it is not
a workspace-wide export.

### Configure and register

Create a Notion integration with AI Meeting Notes and Read Content access.
Grant User Information access if you want attendee IDs resolved to verified
emails and relationship participants. Without it, meetings still sync, but
attendees remain display-only names or IDs.

```toml
[[notion_meetings]]
identifier = "notion-personal"
account_email = "you@example.com"
token = "ntn_..."
schedule = "15 */6 * * *"         # optional daemon schedule
enabled = true
```

Keep `config.toml` owner-readable: the token is read from config and is never
written to logs, sync cursors, archived raw evidence, or command output.

```bash
msgvault add-notion-meetings notion-personal
msgvault sync-notion-meetings notion-personal --probe
```

Both commands print capability and result-count diagnostics without printing
meeting titles, notes, transcripts, attendee details, block IDs, page URLs, or
the token.

### Sync and discovery limit

```bash
msgvault sync-notion-meetings                         # all configured identities
msgvault sync-notion-meetings notion-personal        # one identity
msgvault sync-notion-meetings notion-personal --limit 3
msgvault sync-notion-meetings --full
msgvault sync-notion-meetings --after 2026-01-01
```

Notion's Meeting Notes query currently returns at most 50 records and can say
that more exist without providing a cursor. msgvault makes one maximum-size
query per run, never loops the same page, and reports partial coverage when
Notion sets `has_more`. This means native sync is reliable for the visible
recent window but is not a complete historical workspace export.

Every run fetches the details of visible meetings that pass your filters.
Unchanged content is skipped. Use `--full` to send those meetings through the
archive update path again when stored sync state and archived content disagree.
It still cannot discover history beyond the visible window.

- `--after` filters meetings returned by Notion locally and implies `--full`.
- `--limit` caps the visible meetings fetched and checked.
- Due transcript retries run in addition to that limit.

Notion may publish notes before a transcript. Missing transcripts retry every
six hours until seven days after the best known meeting end, or for 48 hours
from discovery when timing is unknown. A temporary omission never erases a
transcript already archived. Hard per-meeting failures retain the previous
successful state; meetings written earlier in that failed run remain safe and
idempotent.

### What gets stored (Notion)

Each meeting-note block becomes one `meeting_transcript` message in a
`meeting` conversation. Its block ID identifies the meeting on later syncs.
The body includes title, time, attendees, summary, notes, and transcript
sections. The raw archive (`notion_meeting_json`) keeps the source meeting
object, note blocks, Markdown, attendee labels, resolved user details, and
warnings for later inspection.

Notion's `created_by` user is stored as creator metadata and is never assumed
to be the organizer. Only attendees with provider-verified email addresses
become participant rows. Unknown IDs and names remain display-only evidence.

If registration reports invalid token, Meeting Notes access, or Read Content
errors, correct that integration capability and rerun `add-notion-meetings`.
User Information errors are non-fatal. Remove the archive source with:

```bash
msgvault remove-account notion-personal --type notion_meetings --yes
```

A configured schedule will then refuse to recreate it until
`add-notion-meetings` is run again.

## Circleback

Circleback exposes no REST API — msgvault pulls data through its MCP server
(OAuth with dynamic client registration; no secret lives in your config).

### Configure and authorize

```toml
[[circleback]]
identifier = "work"              # stable source label and token key
account_email = "you@example.com" # primary identity for organizer matching
schedule = "30 */6 * * *"        # optional: daemon cron schedule
enabled = true
```

```bash
msgvault add-circleback work
```

This opens a browser for Circleback authorization and stores the token under
`tokens/circleback_<identifier>.json`.

Circleback OAuth uses a fixed `localhost:8090` callback. With a configured
remote msgvault server, `add-circleback` fails before proxying because the
callback and token must live on the daemon host. Run the command in a shell on
that host instead. When connecting over SSH, forward the callback port:

```bash
ssh -L 8090:localhost:8090 user@daemon-host
# In that SSH session:
msgvault --local add-circleback work
```

If the remote host cannot open your workstation's browser, copy the printed
authorization URL into a local browser. The callback reaches the daemon-host
process through the SSH tunnel. On the daemon host, `--local` means that host's
own archive; on a workstation it would authorize a separate local archive
instead of the configured remote.

### Sync

```bash
msgvault sync-circleback                     # all configured accounts
msgvault sync-circleback --limit 5           # limited validation sync
msgvault sync-circleback --full              # re-fetch everything
msgvault sync-circleback --probe             # print tool inventory + sample result
```

Each incremental run enumerates meeting IDs without a scheduled-date bound,
so a newly created backfill is discovered even when the meeting happened long
ago. Unknown meetings and known meetings created within the 48-hour refresh
overlap are fetched in detail. Identical snapshots are skipped without
invalidating the search cache; edits to older known meetings are picked up by
`--full`.

Circleback can publish notes before its transcript is ready. A recognized
missing or empty transcript is archived with state `pending`, then retried on
a six-hour cadence. The retry deadline is seven days after the scheduled
meeting time; records without usable times use a bounded 48-hour window.
Future meetings first retry at their known end time (or start plus one hour).
When the deadline expires the state becomes `unavailable`; `--full` can check
and promote it later if a transcript appears.

Due transcript maintenance is processed before newly searched meetings and is
not counted against `--limit`. For example, `--limit 5` means at most five new
search results plus every bounded maintenance item that is due. Provider,
contract, missing-result, ingest, archive-recovery, and cancellation failures
fail the sync run and leave the prior successful cursor in place; item-atomic
writes completed before the error remain safe to revisit on the next run.

Circleback's tool outputs have no published schema. If a sync imports
meetings with missing fields, run `--probe` to see the live field names —
the importer archives verbatim payloads for successfully decoded results.
Schema-drift payloads that cannot be decoded are rejected instead; diagnose
them with `--probe`, then run `--full` after decoder support is updated.

### What gets stored (Circleback)

In addition to the shared fields above: action items (title, assignee,
status), insights, and tags land in the message metadata and body; the
meeting recording URL and `recording_url_fetched_at` remain in the archived
provider metadata. msgvault does not expose recording URLs as durable
attachments, and downloading or archiving recording media is not supported.
