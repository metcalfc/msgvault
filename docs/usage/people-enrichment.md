title: External Person Enrichment
description: Look up public profile information with explicit provider policies, request limits, and opt-outs.
---

External enrichment looks up public information about tracked people and adds
supported results to their profile fact history. It sends selected identifiers,
such as a name and current company, to Exa or Sixtyfour. It does not send
archived conversations; [profile sweeps](/docs/usage/people-automation/) handle
facts extracted from your archive.

Enrichment is disabled by default. Each provider needs its own policy, request
limits, and consent. Existing [fact pins](/docs/usage/people-automation/#understand-and-correct-automatic-facts)
also apply to enrichment results.

## Choose a provider and eligible identifiers

| Provider mode | Identity required in the saved profile | Result path |
|---|---|---|
| Exa `people` | A public profile URL, or both name and current company | One typed person result; supported fields include location and employment |
| Exa `deep` or `deep-reasoning` | A public profile URL | Structured results for the requested supported fields |
| Sixtyfour | Both name and current company | An asynchronous job, polled until completion or its age limit |

`allowed_identifiers` is the exact list of identifier classes the provider may
receive: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `current_company`, and
`public_profile_url`. A field being present locally does not override that list.
Sixtyfour's allowed list must include both `name` and `current_company`.

Results still need to match the person and pass the fact resolver's evidence
checks. A provider response is a proposed claim, not an instruction to overwrite
the profile. An unsupported field or insufficient identity can stop the request
before a useful result is produced.

## Configure a bounded lookup

First, create a [saved profile](/docs/usage/people/#promote-a-durable-person)
with the required identity details and run `msgvault person track 7`.
Inspect `msgvault person facts catalog` for the fields that automation can
maintain. Configuration uses the catalog's **key**, not its slug.

The example below requests only the shipped `location` field from Exa. Add it
to the daemon host's `config.toml` after reviewing the provider's retention and
training terms. Replace the posture strings with your explicit assessment;
msgvault records these assertions but does not establish the provider's terms.

```toml
[people.enrichment]
enabled = true
schedule = "*/15 * * * *"
batch_size = 5
suppression_key_env = "MSGVAULT_ENRICHMENT_SUPPRESSION_KEY"

[[people.enrichment.providers]]
name = "public-profile"
kind = "exa"
enabled = true
api_key_env = "EXA_API_KEY"
mode = "people"
allowed_identifiers = ["name", "current_company"]
# Stable key for the seeded location field; verify with person facts catalog.
target_keys = ["2068efb0-9808-498b-ac3a-8e0a87d4513a"]
retention_posture = "provider-declared"
training_posture = "provider-declared"
refresh_interval = "720h"
max_requests_per_run = 5
max_requests_per_day = 20
```

Provide `EXA_API_KEY` and `MSGVAULT_ENRICHMENT_SUPPRESSION_KEY` in the daemon's
environment, then restart it. The suppression key must be a persistent secret
of at least 32 bytes. It creates keyed fingerprints for opt-outs; keep it with
your deployment secrets and backups. Replacing it without migrating the saved
suppression state causes a key-mismatch error.

The default Exa endpoint is `https://api.exa.ai/search`. Sixtyfour uses
`https://api.sixtyfour.ai/people-intelligence-async` and
`https://api.sixtyfour.ai/job-status`, requires an explicit `tier`, and uses
`SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY` by default. Its request and polling endpoints must have the
same origin. Neither provider accepts HTTP endpoints.

For Sixtyfour, the polling interval defaults to 30 seconds, the maximum job age
to 15 minutes, and the retry count to 5. Provider requests default to a one-minute
timeout. `refresh_interval`, `target_keys`, `max_requests_per_run`, and
`max_requests_per_day` must be explicit. Sensitive targets additionally require
`allow_sensitive_targets = true`.

Current provider adapters enforce request limits. They reject positive hard
monetary caps because they cannot guarantee the provider's maximum charge.
Leaving the three `max_cost_usd_micros_*` settings at zero selects request-limit
accounting; it does not make requests free.

## Review the policy and grant consent

Restarting with valid configuration registers the exact provider policy. It
does not grant consent:

```bash
msgvault daemon restart
msgvault person enrichment profiles --json
msgvault person enrichment status --json
```

Copy the intended profile's fingerprint after reviewing the full policy. Then
grant consent and request one person with a unique operation key:

```bash
msgvault person enrichment consent <fingerprint>
msgvault person enrichment run --person 7 --provider public-profile \
  --idempotency-key person-7-initial-lookup --json
```

Reuse the same idempotency key when retrying that operation. The command prints
the saved run state. A job waiting on a provider or retry delay can remain in
progress; the daemon resumes queued and running work on later scheduled wakes.
Tracking, changed identity, expired claims, and the configured refresh interval
can also create maintenance work.

A change to the consented policy creates a different fingerprint and requires
new consent. Sweep-provider consent and semantic-embedding consent do not
cover external enrichment.

## Stop lookups for a person or provider

Suppress a person to record an opt-out for all their current identifiers.
This mode does not accept `--provider` or identifier metadata:

```bash
msgvault person enrichment suppress --person 7 --reason opt_out
```

`--reason` accepts `opt_out` or `data_subject_request`. You can also suppress one
identifier from standard input, without putting its value in a command argument:

```bash
msgvault person enrichment suppress --provider public-profile \
  --identifier-class email --reason opt_out < identifier.txt
```

The suppression history stores keyed digests instead of raw identifiers.
Suppression is checked before provider requests. Keep the key available even if
enrichment is disabled: deleting a profile with enrichment history needs it to
record suppression for that person's identifiers.

To stop a particular policy, revoke its fingerprint. To stop all currently
consented enrichment policies, use `--all`:

```bash
msgvault person enrichment revoke <fingerprint>
msgvault person enrichment revoke --all
msgvault person enrichment status --json
```

Revocation stops future authorized lookups. It does not erase previously
returned facts or ask an external provider to delete information. Review saved
results through `person facts evidence`, `claims`, and `decisions`.

## Identity checks beyond exact matching

A returned person is accepted only when both the name and the current company
match the request exactly. Two optional steps widen that safely: a
deterministic retry with a code-built name variant when a provider returns
nothing (a second provider call, counted against the same request caps),
and a consent-gated semantic check that asks Jev whether a partial
match is the same person. Attempts the check cannot decide are recorded as
`identity_uncertain` with no claim applied and appear in
`person enrichment status`. See [Jev judgments](jev-judgments.md).
