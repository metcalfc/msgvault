description: Archive Microsoft Teams chats and channels through delegated Microsoft Graph sync.
---

Search Teams chats, channel discussions, and replies alongside your email and
other messages. msgvault archives their text, participants, source JSON, and
eligible inline images through Microsoft Graph.

Teams messages use `message_type = teams`. Sync reads the provider without
sending messages, editing Teams content, or changing channel membership.

## Prerequisites

Teams ingestion uses Microsoft Graph delegated OAuth, not IMAP. It requires the
same `[microsoft]` `client_id` config block used by `add-o365`, but it stores a
separate Graph token under `tokens/teams_<email>.json`. An Outlook IMAP token
created by `add-o365` does not authorize Teams sync.

Register a Microsoft Entra app as described in
[OAuth Setup](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#microsoft-365-outlook-hotmail), with:

- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8089/callback/microsoft`
- Public client flows enabled
- Delegated Microsoft Graph permissions:
  `Chat.Read`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `Team.ReadBasic.All`,
  `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, `User.Read`, `User.ReadBasic.All`,
  `TeamMember.Read.All`, and `ChannelMember.Read.All`

Some tenants require an administrator to grant consent for channel-message
permissions before users can authorize the app.

Configure msgvault:

```toml
[microsoft]
client_id = "your-azure-app-client-id"
# tenant_id = "your-org-tenant-id"  # optional; default is "common"
```

## Authorize Teams

```bash
msgvault add-teams user@example.com
```

The command opens a browser, requests the Graph scopes above, verifies the
returned identity, stores the token as `teams_user@example.com.json`, creates a
`teams` source, and confirms the account email as the default "me" identity.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--tenant` | Azure AD tenant ID for this authorization; defaults to `common` |
| `--no-default-identity` | Do not auto-confirm the email address as this source's "me" identity |

## Sync Teams

```bash
# Full first run or incremental later runs are auto-detected.
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com

# Chats only
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --no-channels

# Test with a per-conversation limit
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --limit 100

# Re-fetch all messages and upsert them in place
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --full
```

The first run walks chats, joined teams, channels, root channel messages, and
replies. Later runs resume from stored cursors and checkpoints. If a run is
interrupted, re-run `sync-teams`; completed conversations are skipped and
incomplete ones continue.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--no-channels` | Sync chats only and skip team channels |
| `--limit` | Maximum messages per conversation (`0` means no limit) |
| `--full` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch every message, repairing/backfilling rows in place |

## What Gets Archived

- One-on-one chats, self-chat, group chats, meeting chats, team channels, and
  channel replies.
- Plain-text body text derived from Graph HTML bodies, plus the original HTML
  body when present.
- Sender and conversation members as participants, so Teams contacts can appear
  in the same contact graph as email and text-message contacts.
- The original Graph message JSON in raw-message storage with format
  `teams_json`.
- Link attachments as attachment references.
- Inline hosted-content images downloaded into msgvault's attachment store.
- Call-recording event links in the searchable body text.

Self-chat is included automatically when the account has messages to itself;
it needs no extra configuration. A failed self-chat check is reported in the
sync error count while ordinary chats continue.

Deleted Teams messages are marked deleted in the archive when Graph reports a
`deletedDateTime`; previously archived content is retained.

## Inline Media Backfill

If you imported Teams messages before inline hosted-content downloads were
available, or a transient Graph error left some inline images missing, run:

```bash
msgvault backfill-teams-media user@example.com
msgvault backfill-teams-media user@example.com --only-incomplete
```

The backfill scans stored Teams HTML bodies for `hostedContents` URLs and
downloads eligible images. Files with the same content share storage. The
[media policy](#media-policy) still determines which conversations and file
sizes are eligible.

## Media Policy

Attachment downloads follow the shared chat media policy. By default media
from chats and channels with more than 20 members is skipped with a typed
`participant_threshold` marker, while one-to-one and small group chats keep
theirs. Adjust it under `[teams]`:

```toml
[teams]
media = true
media_scope = "all"            # all, direct (chats only), or none
media_max_participants = 20    # 0 = no cap
max_media_mb = 250

[teams.accounts_config."user@example.com"]
max_media_mb = 500
```

See [Media policy](/docs/configuration/#media-policy) for the full vocabulary and
`msgvault purge-excluded-media` for removing media a changed policy would no
longer collect.

## Scheduled Sync

`msgvault serve` can schedule Teams syncs through the normal `[[accounts]]`
block after `add-teams` creates the source and token:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "user@example.com"
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
enabled = true
```

The scheduler resolves the entry to the `teams` source when that account has a
Teams source. Scheduled Teams syncs include channels.

## Search and Query

Teams messages use `message_type = teams`:

```bash
msgvault search "incident review" --message-type teams
msgvault search "message_type:teams incident review"
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT sent_at, from_email, subject, snippet
  FROM v_messages
  WHERE message_type = 'teams'
  ORDER BY sent_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

Manual `sync-teams` does not run the embedding worker immediately. If vector
search is enabled and you want newly synced Teams messages in semantic/hybrid
results, run `msgvault embeddings build` after the sync, or configure
`[vector.embed.schedule].run_after_sync = true` for scheduled daemon syncs.

In the [Web UI](/docs/web-ui/), Teams direct chats, group chats, and channel
conversations appear as conversation rows in the [Inbox](/docs/web-ui/#inbox-and-search) and can be combined
with the same search, filters, and grouping as other archive modalities. In
the [TUI](/docs/usage/tui/), press `m` to switch from Email mode to Texts mode.
