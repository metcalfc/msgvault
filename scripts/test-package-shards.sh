#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run one Go package's tests as several concurrent processes.
#
# A package's tests run one at a time inside a single test binary, so a package
# with thousands of tests sets the wall clock for the whole job no matter how
# many cores the runner has. This compiles the package once, lists its tests,
# deals them round-robin into shards, and runs each shard as its own process
# with -test.run pinned to exactly its names. The tests, their order within a
# shard, and the binary are unchanged; only the process boundary is new.
#
# Usage: scripts/test-package-shards.sh <package> [shards=4] [tags] [timeout=60m]
