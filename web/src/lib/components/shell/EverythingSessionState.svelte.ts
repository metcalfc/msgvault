/**
 * Session-scoped state for the Everything workspace that must survive a
 * workspace round-trip (navigating away from 'everything' and back).
 *
 * AppShell renders EverythingWorkspace behind an `{#if}` chain alongside the
 * other workspaces, so Svelte destroys and recreates it on every such
 * switch. Before EverythingWorkspace was split out of AppShell, this state
 * lived at AppShell's persistent top level and never lost continuity; this
 * container restores that by living in AppShell (instantiated once, like the
 * loader/controller) and being passed down as a prop. EverythingWorkspace
 * reads and writes through it while keeping its own `$effect`s, in-flight
 * `AbortController`s, and timer handles local to each mount.
